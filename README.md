# Delaware County Fair Auction App
This app is in tandem with the mobile app [here](https://github.com/danield33/AuctionMobileApp).

## Description
This app was designed for the intent of being able to select 
participants in an auction to be selected and displayed on all
the devices connected to a web-socket server running on a device.
Without the server running and properly connected, it will not work
as intended. You can find the web-socket [here](https://github.com/danield33/AuctionWebsocket).

## Usage
To use this app, have npm and electron installed and run 
* npm install
* npm run dev
